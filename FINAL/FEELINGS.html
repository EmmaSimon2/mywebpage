      <h3> this year has been a whole hell of a lot of mixed feelings.<br>
      as time has gone on, all concepts of reality have started to dissipate<br>
      i watch shows and get upset when people aren't wearing masks in the shows<br>
      like i know it's just a show, but somehow this year has been so traumatic<br>
      that small things like this are so far from our current reality that i get upset<br>
      as time keeps moving forward and things only seem to get worse, i'm plagued <br>
      with the idea that the pandemic will end and my youth will be over<br>
      this is probably untrue and i can rationally think through things<br>
      but as much as i am taking everything seriously, i want normality so much <br>
      if there is even a turning back to the before<br>
      <br>
      on the flipside, this year has allowed me so many freedoms i never could have imagined<br>
      i didn't work this summer, i spent so much time outside and finally receiving<br>
      the break i've been asking for since i was 15<br>
      i feel privileged and lucky for my health<br>
      somedays i've felt invincible, on top of the world and overwhelming amounts of joy<br>
      despite some of the lowest lows, i've coped surprisingly well<br>
      finally utilizing all of the coping mechanisms i learned in therapy 8 years ago<br>
      i've found passion and joy out of new hobbies<br>
      i've realized the importance of human connection and after years of trying to escape<br>
      i've realized that maybe i actually want to stay<br>
      <br>
      but yeah, i guess this has all been a big learning experience<br>
       and i'm lucky to have that perspective<br>
      it shows how extremely priviliged i am<br>
      that despite the abundance of trauma this year<br>
      i know i am ok and that i have been able to find silver linings<br>
      many haven't been afforded that perspective<br>
      but even so, i hope this pandemic ends<br>
      i hope i don't lose anymore friends, to mental health or covid<br>
      i just want to feel kind of normal again.
